# Yet Another Rewrite of Cobalt Botterfly [WIP]

This is a second rewrite of Cobalt, the bot of the Discord server
[Star vs. the Forces of Discord](https://discord.gg/svtfoe). It uses my
[Geode](https://github.com/410757864530-dead-salmonids/geode) framework for database integration, and is heavily based
on my [previous rewrite](https://github.com/410757864530-dead-salmonids/cobalt-cluster) of Cobalt.

It is a work in progress -- any crystals (modules) that are complete are found in
[the main branch](app/main), and any that are unfinished are in [the dev branch](app/dev).

You can find me on the SVTFOE server, I'm `410,757,864,530 DEAD SALMONIDS#0659`.
